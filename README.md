These are the answers for a quiz / test on parts of **object-oriented programming.**

To make it usable, remove the declarations of variables and the bodies of methods as necessary. 

To test your code, the main method runs through some tests that will tell you, at the end, whether or not you wrote the code correctly. 

This quiz tests:

1. Method signatures
2. Inheritance
3. Abstraction
4. Sets
5. For-loops and if-statements
6. Enums
7. Constructors and the *new* keyword
8. The *this* keyword
9. Visibility modifiers
10. Having code in different classes and packages

Some things it doesn't test that might be important:

1. The *static* keyword
2. Arrays
3. Switch-case-break
